Scripts and programs that I'm writing for my friends, also some of them I use at my work.

Programs:

AddLogo - App that helps me to add logo to multiple photos at the same time. I'm still working on object detection.

RunApp - App that opens websites, also it allows to run programs and move them to selected place on screen. App stores data in .json file. Feel free to download run.exe file and try it out.

Scripts:

folderCreator - Creates dictionaries, it uses .txt file to get dictionaries names

linkChecker - Checks HTTP status codes of given links, creates .txt file that contains all links that return status code other than 200.
